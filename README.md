## ReapTEC
This repository provides scripts to run the ReapTEC (read-level pre-filtering and transcribed enhancer call) pipeline. 
By leveraging a unique “cap signature” derived from the 5'-end of a transcript, ReapTEC simultaneously profiles 
gene expression and enhancer activity at nucleotide resolution using 5′-end single-cell RNA-sequencing (5′ scRNA-seq).
The flow of analysis and a brief description of the scripts is provided below. The details are described in the STARsolo_ReapTEC_logfile.
